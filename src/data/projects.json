Start with calculations of diabatic interaction potentials for the CO-CO* excimer with existing electronic structure methods and with the SAPT and SAPT(DFT) methods for the CO-CO* excimer and the computation of the CO-CO* excimer spectrum. Apply SAPT-based methods to larger complexes such as the benzene dimer. Results from DC1 will be used if possible.",

Correction to the PM6 model will be evaluated from this data set, and an analytical correction function will be obtained through fitting.

In this project we aim to fix both problems and implement solutions in Tinker-HP. 1) Develop and/or collect reference many-body data on small molecular clusters and single molecule properties for flexible molecules. 2) Establish state-of-the-art by comparisons against models developed using Reg-SAPT(DFT), AMOEBA, and other relevant polarizable force-fields. 3) Develop theoretical framework for bare multipoles and polarizabilities which, when coupled, are able to reproduce reference properties from (1). 4) Develop consistent model for many-body charge-delocalisation based on unified reg-SAPT(DFT) and Thole-damped classical polarizable models. 5) Benchmark models against reference data from (1) and apply to molecular crystals in Tinker-HP.",

A critical task is the development of accurate interaction models, particularly of the dispersion interaction, which are capable to characterising the interaction of the confined object (AQCs) by the confining environments, and also account for excitations.

Steps: 1) Develop atomistic methods to assess the free energy of solvent pockets and channels against experimental stability information for solvates and neat forms. 2) Design and implement an automated procedure for the atomistic modelling calculation of the free energy of solvate pockets and channels for experimental crystal structures (from crystallographic databases) and/or putative crystal structures (from CSP). 3) Develop and parameterize a machine-learning implicit solvent model that assesses the pocket and channel free energy taking the cavity shape, size and surface charge density distribution as input.",
